# UNS Integration

### Login with Unstoppable Domain

- Demo [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiF1Q-PDyws&t=0s) - "Login chapter" 0:00-0:30

### Integrating UNS Domain Resolution

- A Supporter can search for a creator using either UNS domain or Ethereum address. then she/he can subscribe to the creator's subscription plans or send tip to the creator.

  - Demo [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiF1Q-PDyws&t=135s) - "Subscribe to a plan chapter" 2:15-3:11
  - Demo [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiF1Q-PDyws&t=362s) - "Send tip chapter" 6:02-6:45

- If a supporter had a UNS domain, the creator could fetch the domain-associated records. e.g. the creator could fetch the email address record and use it to send exclusive content to the supporter.
